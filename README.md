This app doesn't work yet. But when it does it will be a podcast feed made of episodes I like from other podcasts.

## How it works
My podcast player is synced with [feedly](http://feedly.com). This app is synced with feedly. When I favourite an episode, this app and adds it to the feed.

## To do
* ~~Get the app reading ids from feedly~~
* ~~Check if the feedly ids are already present locally~~
* ~~Make the second request to get the title, description etc~~
* ~~Store feedly_id, show, title, description and whole API output json~~
* Render a podcast feed
* Host it somewhere so I can check it actually works
* Check for new episodes every hour or every day
* Make it look good
* Post to [@henrylistens](https://twitter.com/henrylistens) when a new episode is added
